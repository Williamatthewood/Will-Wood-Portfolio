# Will-Wood-Portfolio

## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Description

This application is a work-in-progress portfolio as I begin my journey as a developer. I have laidout the main structure of the application and stylized it for visual appeal and responsive design. The objectives of this application were to create an "About Me", "My Work", and "Contact" section, accessible by clicking on navigation links at the top of the page. Additionally, my first project is featured, designed to be twice as large as the next two. I utilized flexbox and media queries to allow the site to be responsive to different screen widths, targetted it at laptops, tablets, and phones. As I get more projects under my belt and increase my fluency in web design, I will continue to add and modify this project.
